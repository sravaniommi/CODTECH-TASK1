Domain:VLSI

Duration:June to August 2024.

Mentor:Muzammil Ahmed.

**Overview of the project**

Project:Digital Logic Design With Verilog.

TOOL USED:EDA Playground.

Objective:The objective of this task is to design basic digital logic circuits like logic gates, adders, and multipexers using Verilog within the VLSI software. Simulate the verilog design to ensure correct functionality.Use the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to analyze the simulation results.

**LOGIC GATES**

inputs: i1, i2

outputs: o1,o2o3,o4,o5,o6,o7

Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions and are implemented using electronic switches such as transistors. Each gate corresponds to a function in Boolean algebra, which is used to describe logical relationships in binary systems (0 and 1).

AND Gate: Performs the AND operation on inputs i1 and i2. The output is 1 only if both inputs are 1; otherwise, the output is 0.

OR Gate: Performs the OR operation on inputs i1 and i2. The output is 0 only if both inputs are 0; otherwise, the output is 1.

NAND Gate: Performs the NAND operation on inputs i1 and i2. The output is 0 only if both inputs are 1; otherwise, the output is 1.

NOR Gate: Performs the NOR operation on inputs i1 and i2. The output is 1 only if both inputs are 0; otherwise, the output is 0.

XOR Gate: Performs the XOR operation on inputs i1 and i2. The output is 1 only if the inputs are different; if both inputs are the same, the output is 0.

XNOR Gate: Performs the XNOR operation on inputs i1 and i2. The output is 1 only if the inputs are the same; if the inputs are different, the output is 0.

NOT Gate: Produces the complement of the input i1. If the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice versa.

**4bit FULLADDER**


inputs:a, b, cin

outputs:sum,cout

A 4-bit full adder is a combinational logic circuit designed to perform the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers. It takes into account the carry generated by each bit addition and outputs a 4-bit sum and a carry-out.
The 4-bit full adder is an essential building block in digital systems, capable of adding two 4-bit binary numbers while considering carry inputs and outputs. This circuit is widely used in arithmetic logic units (ALUs), digital processors, and other computing systems where binary addition is required.
The outputs sum and cout are reg datatypes because the outputs continuously changes as the any one of the input changes.

**16bit MULTIPLEXER**

inputs:in, sel

output:out

Multiplexer is a combinational circuit whose output depends only on the present inputs. Multiplexer having 2^n inputs , n sel inputs, 1 output (2^n:n:1).
A 16-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) is a digital switch that selects one of 16 input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is controlled by four select lines. The output out is determined by the values of the select lines sel0, sel1, sel2, sel3.The combination of these select lines decides which input is routed to the output. for example if select input is 0010 then the output out is in2.
